This plugin is a total revamp of jquery.appear plugin hosted on http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/

It mimics a custom "appear" event, which fires when an element scrolls into view or otherwise becomes visible to the user.

$('someselector').appear();
$('someselector').on('appear', function() {
  // this element is now inside browser viewport
});


$('#foo').appear(function() {
  $(this).text('Hello world');
});

This plugin can be used to prevent unnecessary requests for content that's hidden or outside the viewable area.
